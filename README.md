# PR War Room

Multi-agent AI **pre-review** orchestrator for GitHub pull requests.

Run it on a PR *before* you request human review. It ingests the PR, builds a
review context packet, runs multiple independent AI review agents, deduplicates
and challenges their findings, ranks what a human reviewer would actually care
about, and produces a short, actionable report — with optional local fix
patches.

> Goal: not to replace human review, but to make every PR significantly more
> review-ready before a teammate ever looks at it.

## Status

This repo is being built in phases (see `Full PRD.rtf`). **Phase 1** is
implemented: the CLI skeleton, configuration system, PR-URL parsing, and the
`.ai-review/` artifact layout. GitHub ingestion and the AI agents arrive in
later phases.

## Requirements

- Node.js **>= 22**
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (v10+)

## Install & build

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build      # bundles to dist/ via tsup
```

## Usage

```bash
# During development (runs TypeScript directly via tsx):
pnpm dev review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123

# After build (or when installed globally):
pr-war-room review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123
```

Every run writes artifacts under `.ai-review/` in the current directory. In
Phase 1, `review` parses the URL, resolves config, and writes
`.ai-review/run_metadata.json`.

`fix` and `eval` are registered but not yet implemented.

## Configuration

Config is optional. Defaults are used unless a `.pr-war-room.json` file exists in
the current directory, in which case it is deep-merged over the defaults
(objects merge; arrays replace).

```json
{
  "models": {
    "primaryReviewer": "claude",
    "secondaryReviewer": "codex",
    "judge": "claude"
  },
  "verification": {
    "commands": ["npm test", "npm run lint"]
  },
  "review": {
    "maxFindings": 20,
    "includeNiceToHave": false
  }
}
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm typecheck   # tsc --noEmit (strict)
pnpm test        # vitest
pnpm test:watch
```

### Note on imports (NodeNext ESM)

This project uses `"module": "NodeNext"`. Relative imports in source **must**
include the `.js` extension, even though the source files are `.ts`:

```ts
import { parsePrUrl } from "./parsePrUrl.js"; // correct
```
